<h1> Characteristics of the Dhole </h1>
<h3> Current habitat </h3>
<a name=hab></a>
<p>The Dhole's historic range was extending from Indonesia to southern Russia to the eastern edge of Uzbekistan.
However, the Dhole has been receded to three different areas: the south-western forests of China, eastern India, and the Indochinese Peninsula and Malaysia.
Current estimates state that it's habitat could be reduced to north-eastern India and southern China.
Most of it's current habitat is some form of deciduous forest, whether it is extremely dry or a dripping rainforest. It can also be found in large meadows and flat steppes.
The plants that are within the biome include bamboo, the Durian, and the Kapok tree.
The Dholes are currently heavily emigrating, as they are currently being driven out of their natural habitat.

<h3> Appearance and Adaptation </h3>
<a name=adapt></a>
<p>The Dhole is typically rust colored and has a slender appearance, with slim legs and a long backbone, it's been said that it looks like common hyenas. 
The Dhole is characterised as smaller and stouter than it's descendants. </br>
Male Dholes are usually 40 pounds, and the females are usually about 30 pounds. They are also usually 16-22 inches at shoulder height and 3 feet in length.</br>
Some of the unique adaptations that the Dhole has are a short,thick jaw and one less tooth on both sides of it's lower jaw. </br></p>

<h3> Extended classification </h3>
<a name=class></a>
<p>The Dhole is classified under: </br>
</br>
Kingdom: Animalia </br>
Phylum: Chordata </br>
Class: Mammalia </br>
Order: Carnivora </br>
Family: Canidae </br>
Genus: Cuon </br>
Species: C. alpinus </br> </p>
<h3> Nutrition and Ecosystem Role </h3>
<a name=nner></a>
<p>The Dhole is an omnivore and a tertiary consumer. They usually hunt low-level prey such as deer and pigs, 
but on occasion and with enough pack members they are able to take down larger prey such as a wild cow 
called the Gaur. If there is not enough meat to go around they  will seek out wild fruits, such as wild apples and hawthorn.
An example of a food web is the Dhole on top, followed by the monkey, followed by insects that the monkey eats, finalised by the dead carcase the insects ate.</p></br>

<h3> Reproduction </h3>
<a name=smex></a>
<p>The Dhole reproduce about every year or so. Their reproduction is K-type, usually bearing up to 16 pups per pregnancy. 
The average gestation period is about two months and the weaning period is about the same length, give or take a few days.</p>
<h1> The Dhole's Current threats, and my ideas for the species. </h1>
<h3> Current Threats </h3>
<a name=dngr></a>
<p>There are many prominent threats to the Dhole which include:</p>
<ul>
<li> Habitat lost due to, but not limited to, deforestation.</li>
<li> The alarming decrease of their primary prey, ungulates (deer, wild horses, and rams)</li>
<li> New diseases from domesticated dog species, that the Dhole has never encountered.</li>
<li> <b> Human persecution and hunting </b> </li> 
</ul>
<h3> Current conservation efforts </h3>
<a name=ccon></a>
<p>Currently, there is under-sufficient protection for the Dhole. The current legal protection of the Dhole is in 
the following:</p> 
<ul>
<li>India, under Schedule 2 in the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.</li>
<li>Russia, since 1974 </li>
<li>China, Wildlife Protection Act of 1988, Category II</li>
<li>Cambodia </li>
<li>Vietnam, various conservation laws </li>
</ul>
<h3> My conservation idea</h3>
<a name=mcon></a>
<ol>
<li>Create international recognition of the Dhole, and ban its killing.</li>
<li>End the harvest of the Dhole's habitat, and prevent it from continuing.</li>
<li>End the harvest of the animals that the Dhole prey upon.</li>
<li>Treat the diseases that the domestic dog species introduced to the Dhole</li>
<li>Track and monitor the population of Dholes.</li>
</ol>
